Introduction
This research examines whether beginners in Python can create machine learning (ML) models from scratch without using pre-built modules. To fully understand how ML modules are made, exploring the algorithms and calculations underlying them is essential. Harnessing the programming skills gained from the Psych6273 course, alongside insights from a Python programming book and free resources like YouTube, Kaggle, and GitHub, this study aims to not only deepen my understanding of Python but also build a strong foundation in research and data analysis for my masterâ€™s thesis. Through hands-on projects, I will explore and develop machine learning models such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression, translating theoretical concepts into practical, real-world applications. These models have been carefully selected to align with my research design, which involves creating psychological items and questionnaires using large language models. Specifically, k-NN will facilitate classification tasks and cluster analysis for the newly generated psychometric items, while Linear Regression and Logistic Regression serve as essential components within the structural equation modelling framework used to evaluate these psychological items. Mastering the fundamentals of these models is critical to ensuring the success of my data analysis and advancing my research objectives.
By meticulously dissecting each step and coding block, I provide practical guidance for individuals with minimal Python experience (near zero) to comprehend and apply these machine-learning models in psychological studies. I inspire fellow psychological researchers to embrace advanced statistical tools, including machine learning and large language models, to push the boundaries of our field. This study serves as a candid journal, documenting the victories and challenges of my learning journey and offering my insights and encouragement to those venturing into these transformative psychological methods.
