    "The __init__ method initializes the logistic regression model. It sets the learning rate (lr), which controls the step size during optimization, and the number of iterations (n_iters) for gradient descent. It also initializes weights and bias to None, which will later store the model parameters. The learning rate and iteration frequencies (n_iters) can be changed based on your research requirement. The lower the learning rate and higher the iteration, the more precise your model will be. However, the training process may slow down. For a small sample dataset like in the present study did not change the outcome at all.\n",

    "The sigmoid function is a mathematical function used in logistic regression to ensure the output falls between 0 and 1, representing a probability. It belongs to a group of functions known as logistic functions, which share this property (Brownlee, 2016). The sigmoid method applies the sigmoid activation function to a given input z. It maps any real number into a range between 0 and 1, making it useful for converting linear model outputs into probabilities (AssemblyAI, 2022).\n",

    "Similarly to the Linear Regression model, this is where the weight and bias are initially set to zero for the gradient descent loop that starts at the next code block. This process is repeated until the optimal balance is maintained between the two. Detailed description of how the gradient descent process work can be found in my transcript under the Linear Regression model.

    "This code defines the prediction set up in the \"LogisticRegression\" class and tells the model to use the X variable to predict. np.dot() function provides the dot function, where it takes into account the increase or decrease of Y value based on the change in X and add the bias term. The concept of balance between the weights and bias is well explained by James et al, (2023). Highly recommended to read through."
